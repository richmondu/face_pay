# FacePay

FacePay is a revolutionary digital payment solution that utilizes biometrics to authenticate customers.
It will be seamlessly integrated country's leading digital wallets solutions (such as GCash, Paymaya, GrabPay, etc).
It was a proposal submitted to the "ADB Pay: Digital Payments" challenge of ADB-AIM Hackathon 2019.



### Core ideas:

- <b>Face Recognition</b> (with options of Fingerprint biometrics and RFID employee ID)

  Having a facial recognition payment solution will entice employees to use the digital wallet solution instead of cash.
  Employees who opts to use the technology will gain points that can be converted into cash.
  Discounts for senior citizen employees will automatically be deducted.
  Additional gimmicks can be added that will make users acquire more points and thus use the technology more.


- <b>Security</b> (integrated to Amazon Cognito user signup/signin with MFA/OTP via SMS/email)

  By default, an OTP code will be sent to user after user's face has been recognized.
  This enhances security by preventing fraud activities and 
  ensuring user is who he says he is and therefore has access to his mobile phone.


- Integration to <b>Globe's GCash and Smart's Paymaya</b> digital wallet solutions

  <b> There's a lot of digital payments solutions in the country already.
  This includes Globe’s GCash (partnered with Ali Pay), Smart’s PayMaya (partnered with Tencent/WeChat Pay), Coins.ph, GrabPay, etc.
  To create another one will prevent wide-spread usage of the technology.
  </b>

  We don’t want to create another one.
  Rather, we should focus on integrating to country's leading digital wallets solutions. 
  Based on research, we should integrate with GCash and Paymaya.

  This will make employees use the technology more often because they can use it outside ADB premises.
  <b>If employees use the digital wallet solution outside the office, more likely that they will use it inside the ADB office.</b>

  

- Integration to <b>ADB's accounting system</b> for food allowance and bonus allocations

  Food allowances to employees will automatically be transferred to employee's digital wallets.
  A certain portion of yearly bonuses will also be transferred automatically.
  <b>Employees will be allowed to configure how much of their salary will automatically be transfered to their digital wallets every payday</b>.


- <b>Voice assistant</b> (integrated to Amazon Polly for voice enabled instructions)

  A digital voice assistant named <b> DeBbie will guide user through the process.</b>
  This would be really helpful for first time users.


- <b>IoT Kiosks</b>

  The face recognition solution will be deployed in kiosks located in each stores inside ADB.
  The kiosk is a touch-screen monitor that is connected to ADB's private servers and 
  can be controlled remotely by the IT department for management and monitoring.  



### Feasibility:

Facial recognition is already very popular in China.
Paying food using face is already available commercially. 
It is made possible via backend integration with leading digital payment solutions - <b>WeChat Pay</b> and <b>Ali Pay</b>.
