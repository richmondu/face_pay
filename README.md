# FacePay

FacePay is a revolutionary digital payment solution that utilizes biometrics to authenticate customers.
It was a proposal submitted to the "ADB Pay: Digital Payments" challenge of ADB-AIM Hackathon 2019.


### Core ideas:

- Face Recognition (with options of Fingerprint biometrics and RFID employee ID)
- Speech Synthesis (for digital assisstant for voice enabled instructions)
- Amazon Cognito (for user signup/signin with MFA/OTP via SMS/email)
- Integration to Globe's GCash, Smart's Paymaya and digital wallet solutions
- Integration to ADB's accounting system for food allowance and bonus allocations


### Feasibility:

Paying food using facial recognition is already available in China
