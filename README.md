# FacePay

FacePay is a revolutionary digital payment solution that utilizes biometrics to authenticate customers.
It will be seamlessly integrated country's leading digital wallets solutions (GCash, Paymaya, GrabPay).
It was a proposal submitted to the "ADB Pay: Digital Payments" challenge of ADB-AIM Hackathon 2019.


### Core ideas:

- <b>Face Recognition</b> (with options of Fingerprint biometrics and RFID employee ID)

  Having a facial recognition payment solution will entice employees to use the digital wallet instead of cash.
  Employees who opts to use the technology will gain points that can be converted into cash.
  Discounts for senior citizen employees will automatically be deducted.
  Additional gimmicks can be added that will make users acquire more points.
  
- <b>Speech Synthesis</b> (for digital assisstant for voice enabled instructions)

  A digital voice assistant named DeBbie will guide user through the process.
  This would be really helpful for first time users.
  
- <b>Amazon Cognito</b> (for user signup/signin with MFA/OTP via SMS/email)

  By default, an OTP code will be sent to user after user's face has been recognized.
  This enhances security by preventing fraud activities and ensuring user is who he says he is and therefore has access to his mobile phone.
  
- Integration to <b>Globe's GCash, Smart's Paymaya and Grab's GrabPay</b> digital wallet solutions

  There's a lot of digital payments solutions in the country already.
  To create another one will prevent wide-spread usage of the technology.
  We should focus on integrating to digital wallets of top-tier companies.

- Integration to <b>ADB's accounting system</b> for food allowance and bonus allocations

  Food allowances to employees will automatically be transferred to employee's digital wallets.
  A certain portion of yearly bonuses will also be transferred automatically.
